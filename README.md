myblog
======

My own blog, all code will be wrote by me which start from 2014-12-29.

Itâ€™s realy heavy work to write all the code of a blog all by myself. 

It may be better to write single web compontent instead of writing a whole blog.
For example, you can use wordpress but replace or remove some function with your own will.
In a short, not reinvent the wheel.

On the other hand, after writing a number of frontend code, I found it's not wise to write just with jQuery which are better as basic for higher levels of abstraction framework, such as backbone or react.

Someday I'll refactor this and deploy on a virtual host.
